# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CI Workflow
#
# Purpose:
#   This workflow is the main continuous integration (CI) pipeline. It verifies:
#     - Code formatting, linting, type checking via pre-commit hooks
#     - Unit testing via `pytest`
#     - Test coverage reporting (terminal, XML for Codecov, HTML artifact)
#   Tasks run inside an isolated `.venv` environment for reproducibility
#   Makefile targets are used to ensure consistency between local and CI environments
#   The workflow runs on all pushes, pull requests, and can be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`
#
# Discussion notes:
#   - All Python tasks are isolated in a virtual environment (.venv)
#   - Pre-commit hooks run first to enforce code hygiene (black, isort, flake8, vulture, mypy, etc.)
#   - Test and coverage steps are Makefile-driven for local + CI parity
#   - HTML and XML coverage reports are generated for Codecov and GitHub artifact upload
#   - This workflow runs on all pushes, PRs, and manual dispatch triggers
#   - It serves as a signal check before merging — it does NOT alter files
#   - Codecov upload is optional and only triggered if CODECOV_TOKEN is configured
